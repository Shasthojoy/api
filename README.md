# Services API

## Context

In order not to require extensive coding resources for coding websites, democratech makes an extensive use of web services behind the scene, most notably:
* [Bime](https://bimeanalytics.com) for analytics and dashboards
* [Front](http://frontapp.com) for shared inbox
* [Wufoo](https://wufoo.com) for forms
* [Slack](https://slack.com) for communication / notifications
* [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com) for emailing

Nevertheless, we needed an API of ours (Zapier-like) to properly synchronize all those services.

## Process overview

The services API is located on the green "Supporteurs" node.

## About the Services API

The Services API is written in Ruby and leverages the [Grape API framework](https://github.com/ruby-grape/grape).
The Webserver used is [Unicorn](http://unicorn.bogomips.org/) (behing nginx).

## Installing and starting the Services API

1. Make sure your run ```bundle install``` to make sure all dependencies get installed
2. Create a ```config/keys.local.rb``` file with all the necessary information (cf ```config/keys.rb```)
3. launch the unicorn server with the following command:
```
bundle exec unicorn -c config/unicorn.conf.rb config/config.ru
```

Alternatively for development purposes, you can also just run the Services API with rackup to use the default WEBRick web server:
```
rackup config/config.ru
```

## Accessing the Services API

You can test that the Services API is up and running by calling:
```
curl http://127.0.0.1:9292/api/v1/test
```
It should return an HTTP 200 OK
